# Short Description
This simple Spring Boot application demonstrates differences between validation approaches:
* Java Beans Validation API (JSR-303 ... JSR-380)
* Spring-made validation (`org.springframework.validation.Validator`)

Application is a simple web-service with REST API (actually no back-end store for data, this is not required for demonstration).
Application domain is also very simple - just create order for shopping cart.

To run with Spring-made imperative validation approach just use "imperative-way" Spring Profile, or use "aop-way" Spring Profile to run application with JSR-380 validation in AOP style.
With "imperative-way" profile the `OrderServiceWithSpringImperativeValidation` is used, and `OrderServiceWithAopValidation` is used for "aop-way" profile.

Hibernate validator is used to perform JSR-380 validation.

Let's suppose `CheckoutShoppingCartRequest` class being generated by source-code generator from OpenAPI specification,
and some basic validation annotations placed into that class source code. 
But also some complex validation to check shopping-cart item refers to correct catalog item is required. 
For complex validation special JSR-380 constraint implemented and Hibernate validator configured in the `ValidationConfiguration` class.
